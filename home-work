IAM:
IAM Resources:
IAM (Identity and Access Management) has several key resources, including Users, Groups, Roles, Policies, and Permissions.

Deployment Model in IAM:
IAM follows a cloud-based deployment model and is an integral part of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for managing access to AWS resources.

Identities in IAM:
Identities in IAM refer to entities that can be authenticated and authorized to access AWS resources. These include Users, Groups, and Roles.

IAM User:
IAM User is an individual identity associated with your AWS account. It represents a person or service that interacts with AWS.

IAM Group:
IAM Group is a collection of IAM Users. Instead of managing permissions for individual users, you can assign permissions to a group, making it easier to manage access.

IAM Policy:
IAM Policy is a set of permissions that define what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources. Policies can be attached to Users, Groups, or Roles.

IAM Role:
IAM Role is similar to a User but is not associated with a specific identity. It is assumed by entities like Users, Applications, or AWS services for temporary access.

Identity Based Policy Attachment:
Identity-based policies are attached to IAM Users, Groups, or Roles to grant permissions to those entities.

Resource Based Policy Attachment:
Resource-based policies are attached directly to AWS resources like S3 buckets or Lambda functions, defining who can access the resource.

Creating Policy via JSON Code:
Yes, you can create IAM policies using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) code, specifying the permissions and resources.

Default Permission for a User:
By default, when a user is created, they do not have any permissions. Permissions are granted by attaching policies to the user.

Dominator Policy:
There is no specific concept of a "dominator policy" in IAM. It might be a term used in a specific context or organization.

ARN (Amazon Resource Name):
ARN is a unique identifier for AWS resources. It includes information such as the AWS service, region, account ID, resource type, and resource name.

Fields in ARN:
- `arn:aws:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-name`

Types of ARN Partition:
There are two types: `aws` for AWS resources and `aws-cn` for AWS China resources.

Tags:
Tags are key-value pairs that can be added to IAM resources for better organization and management. They help you categorize and track resources.


S3:
Block Storage vs. Object Storage:
- Block Storage: Manages data in fixed-sized blocks, typically used with servers and applications. Offers low-latency access and is ideal for databases and virtual machines.
  
- Object Storage:  Manages data as objects with metadata, suitable for scalable and distributed storage. Ideal for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data like images, videos, and backups.

Static Website vs. Dynamic Website:
- Static Website: Contains fixed content that doesn't change frequently. HTML, CSS, and images are pre-built and delivered to users as is.
  
- Dynamic Website: Content is generated on-the-fly in response to user requests. Often involves databases and server-side processing for personalized content.

Naming Rules:
- S3 Bucket Names: Must be globally unique, between 3 and 63 characters long, and can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods.
  
- S3 Object Names: Case-sensitive, supports most Unicode characters, and has no restrictions on naming conventions.

Major Resource of S3 Bucket:
The major resource in an S3 bucket is the object, which can be any file, including text files, images, videos, etc.

Hosting Static Websites vs. Dynamic Websites:
- Static Websites: Simplicity, lower cost, and faster performance for content that doesn't change often.
  
- Dynamic Websites: Required for interactive content, personalized experiences, and real-time data.

Versioning & Why We Need It:
- Versioning:  Enables the storage of multiple versions of an object in a bucket.
  
- Why We Need It: Helps recover from accidental deletion or overwrites, and provides a history of changes.

Objects and Types of Objects in S3 Bucket:
Objects can be any file, and types include Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier, and more, each with varying costs and retrieval times.

MFA Delete in S3 Bucket:
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Delete adds an extra layer of security, requiring additional authentication to delete objects in a bucket.

S3 Multipart Upload:
A feature to upload large objects in parts, improving efficiency, and enabling pause and resume capabilities.

Storage Classes in Amazon S3:
- Standard
- Intelligent-Tiering
- One Zone-Infrequent Access
- Glacier
- Glacier Deep Archive
- Outposts

ACL (Access Control List):
Defines permissions on S3 objects or buckets, allowing or denying access to specified users or groups.

Why Do We Need ACL:
ACLs control who can access and perform actions on your S3 resources, providing granular control over permissions.

Lifecycle Policy & Rule:
- Lifecycle Policy: Defines actions to be taken on objects over time.
  
- Why We Need It: Automates data management, reduces costs by moving data to cheaper storage classes or deleting obsolete objects.

Making a Bucket Public:
Configure bucket policies or block public access settings to make a bucket public.

Giving Public Access to a Bucket:
Set bucket or object ACLs to allow public access or use bucket policies.

AWS Pricing Factors of S3 Service:
Pricing is based on storage class, storage used, data transfer, requests, and additional features like versioning.

Making an Object Public:
Set the object's ACL to allow public read access or configure a bucket policy.

Configuring Static Website Logs in S3:
Enable server access logging and define the target bucket to store logs for your static website.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
A security feature that controls web page access to resources from different domains.

S3 Inventory:
A feature providing scheduled reports on objects and their metadata for auditing and compliance.

Requester Pays:
A feature where the requester pays for data transfer and request costs, not the bucket owner.

Transfer Acceleration:
Also known as S3 Transfer Acceleration, it improves object upload/download speed using Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. Useful for faster data transfer.
